///
/// `@unchecked Sendable` states the invariant the whole class already runs on and
/// that `AppModel` already depends on with its `nonisolated` handle: every mutable
/// field is touched only from `queue`, and the two callbacks are set once at init
/// before `start()`. The health sweep is the first path that makes the compiler ask
/// — it awaits an actor and comes back on a different thread — but the rule it has
/// to obey is the same one every other path here obeys.
///
/// # Why nothing the main thread calls touches `queue`
///
/// Every read the UI performs used to be `queue.sync`, and `setClamshell` did blocking
/// socket I/O to a root daemon *inside* one. That is the freeze users reported: the
/// menu bar icon stays drawn but stops responding. The mechanism is not subtle — if
/// anything ever blocks this serial queue, the very next `queue.sync` from the main
/// thread never returns, and AppKit has no way to draw a menu for a thread that is
/// parked in `dispatch_sync`.
///
/// The structural answer is the lock-guarded cache below. `snapshot`, `currentSetting`,
/// `currentPattern`, `activeLease` and `currentHealth` are reads of a mirror that the
/// queue refreshes on every `publish()`. They are O(1), they take an uncontended lock
/// held for a handful of instructions, and they *cannot* wait on the runtime queue —
/// so a wedged queue now costs stale data instead of a dead app.
///
/// Timeouts (see `ShellCommand` and `UnixSocket`) are the second half of the same fix.
/// They stop the queue wedging in the first place; the cache stops a wedge being fatal.
/// Neither is sufficient alone: a deadline only shortens a hang, and a cache of a queue
/// that never runs again is just a frozen picture — which is what `isStalled` exists to
/// say out loud.
///
/// The rules for anything added here:
///
/// - Public API the **main thread** can reach: lock read, or `queue.async`. Never
///   `queue.sync`, and never blocking I/O on the caller's thread.
/// - Public API only the **CLI socket handler** reaches (`claim`/`renew`/`release`/
///   `healthNow`): `queue.sync` is allowed, because that handler runs on its own
///   per-connection queue and blocking it delays one command rather than the UI.
/// - Anything already running **on** the queue must never call a `queue.sync` API.
///   `dispatch_sync` onto the serial queue you are already on is an instant, permanent
///   deadlock with no diagnostic. The two escape hatches are `onChange`, which is
///   dispatched to the main queue, and `onAlert`, which is invoked synchronously — so
///   an `onAlert` handler must not call back into a blocking runtime API.
