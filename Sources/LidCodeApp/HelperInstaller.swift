/// Closed-lid mode is the one feature that needs root, and the only route to it used
/// to be: notice the error, find the repo, open a Terminal, run a shell script. The
/// app already contains everything required — the helper binary is bundled at build
/// time — so the missing piece was only ever asking for authorisation.
///
/// **Why not `SMAppService`.** It is the better API and it is on the roadmap, but
/// registering a system daemon through it requires a Developer ID signature and a
/// `Contents/Library/LaunchDaemons` plist that matches it. This build is ad-hoc
/// signed, so `SMAppService` would fail on exactly the machines that need this to
/// work. One authorisation prompt for one `launchctl bootstrap` is the honest
/// version of what the shell script was already doing.
