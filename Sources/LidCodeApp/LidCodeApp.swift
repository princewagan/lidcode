/// Startup and shutdown go through an app delegate rather than `scenePhase`.
///
/// A menu-bar-only app (`LSUIElement`) never reports an `.active` scene phase, so a
/// `scenePhase` hook silently never fires — the socket server would never start and
/// the CLI would sit there talking to nothing. `applicationWillTerminate` is also the
/// only place guaranteed to run on quit, which is where the assertion and the
/// privileged clamshell toggle must be handed back.
///
/// The status item is owned here rather than declared as a `MenuBarExtra`, for two
/// reasons that both showed up as bugs:
///
///   1. **The icon froze.** A `MenuBarExtra` label closure that reads
///      `delegate.model.snapshot` establishes no dependency on it — SwiftUI tracks
///      `ObservableObject` through a property wrapper, and `@NSApplicationDelegateAdaptor`
///      only republishes when the delegate itself is observable. The scene was evaluated
///      once and the glyph never changed again, so a failing health check could never
///      take the icon. Here the icon is driven by an explicit Combine sink.
///
///   2. **Expanding a section closed the panel.** `menuBarExtraStyle(.window)` is backed
///      by an `NSPanel` that dismisses when it resigns key, and every disclosure in the
///      menu changes the panel's height.
///
/// The dropdown itself is a hand-rolled panel (`MenuPanelController`) rather than the
/// `NSPopover` that replaced the `MenuBarExtra` first: a popover cannot hide its callout
/// arrow, and it anchors to a view, which breaks when a menu-bar manager hides the icon
/// by moving it off-screen. See the notes on `MenuPanel`.
