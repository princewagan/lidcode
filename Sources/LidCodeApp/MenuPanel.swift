/// The dropdown, as a borderless panel rather than an `NSPopover`.
///
/// Two things forced this, and neither is fixable on a popover:
///
///   1. **The arrow.** `NSPopover` always draws a callout triangle pointing at its
///      anchor. Almost no menu-bar app has one — the platform convention is a plain
///      rounded rectangle hanging under the status item — and there is no API to turn
///      it off.
///
///   2. **Hidden icons.** A popover anchors to its anchor *view*, so it goes wherever
///      that view is. Menu-bar managers like Ice hide an item by moving it off-screen
///      rather than removing it, so the anchor is still a real view at a nonsense
///      position: the panel flew to the top-left corner and the arrow drew itself
///      inside-out trying to point at something off-screen. A panel positions itself,
///      so it can *notice* the anchor is not somewhere a window should hang from and
///      fall back to the corner of the menu bar instead.
